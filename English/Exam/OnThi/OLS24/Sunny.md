In case mild sunny, I think it's a wonderful time to sunbath in the morning to get Vitamin D.
Moreover it's time to go for the picnic.
In case extremely sunny. It's best to stay at home. If I have to go out I must put on the jacket to avoid UV ray
which can cause skin cancer. I also won't forget to use skin lotion and keep my skin moisturized.
When it's extremely sunny  it's usually scorching hot too. 
I will turn on the AC all day even though I have to pay more for the electricity bill.
If I have to go out I will head for airconditioned places like the coffee shop or the shopping mall. 
Finally, If I want to travel somewhere to escape the heat I will definitely choose Dalat or Sapa 
I will stay there for a couple days to recharge my battery.
