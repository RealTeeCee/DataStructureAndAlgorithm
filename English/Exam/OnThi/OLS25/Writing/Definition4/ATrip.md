# Tell a story about Your Trip

Last week, I had a trip to Binh Hung island with my colleagues. The trip lasted only 2 days and 1 night but we had a lot of fun.
We departed at Mien Dong bus station. It was 11 pm but none of us were sleepy because all of us were eager. However, after a while we fell asleep until we were  waken up by the driver's loud voice. We arrived. We were amazed at the clear aquamarine sea along with the soft white sand. After we had checked in at a local hotel, we quickly put away our luggage and headed for the beach. There, the air was fresh and sunlight was mild. In addition to the sea, we were impresed with the local people's hospitality and super-cheap local food. The most special thing was that Binh Hung's lobster were much cheaper than the restaurant we used to go to. Our 2 days and 1 night passed so fast. We wished we could stay longer but all good things had to come to an end. We had to come back to HCM to start a new work week.
Generally, although our trip was short we enjoyed it so much and looked forward to the day we could return.

===================================================
I had always been fascinated by the idea of exploring new places but never took the initiative to travel far from home. One evening, I stumbled upon a travel documentary about the stunning landscapes of Iceland. By the time the documentary ended, I felt a strong urge to pack my bags and see the world.

I had never been on a solo trip before, but that weekend I booked a flight and set off on an adventure. The journey was exhilarating yet challenging; navigating unfamiliar roads and dealing with language barriers made me wish I had planned better. Despite these obstacles, I pressed on, driven by a sense of curiosity and wonder. By the end of the trip, I had experienced breathtaking sights and made memories that would last a lifetime.

It has been several months since that trip, and I have continued to explore new destinations. Now, I can confidently navigate foreign cities without feeling lost at all. My friend mentioned that he would embark on a solo journey just like me one day.
