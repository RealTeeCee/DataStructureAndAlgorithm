# Tell a story First Day At School

I had always been anxious about starting new chapters in my life, and the first day of school was no exception. Leading up to it, I spent hours preparing, making sure I had everything I needed. I had never been to a school this large before, and the thought of meeting new people made me nervous.

That morning, I arrived early, my heart pounding with anticipation. As I walked through the crowded hallways, I felt a mixture of excitement and fear. The first class was a blur; I struggled to find my seat and kept to myself, wishing I had someone familiar by my side. Despite my nerves, I managed to introduce myself to a few classmates and even participated in a group activity, which eased my anxiety a bit.

It has been several months since that first day, and I have gradually found my place in the school community. Now, I look forward to each day, eager to learn and connect with my peers. My friend mentioned that he would feel more confident starting at a new school just like me one day.
