# Describe HCMC

I am Saigonese and I have been living in HCMC since I was born. In my view, this city is beautiful, modern, and crowded.
First, It is a beautiful city. You can see many skyscrappers everywhere you go. I particularly reccommend that you should visit the Landmark 81 and Bitexco Tower because they are symbols of this city. 
Second, It is a modern city. Currently, a metro system is being built. It will be a greate achievement for this city. Besides, HCMC has a variety of restaurants where you can enjoy various kinds of food in the world. 
Moreover, If you are a shopaholic, HCM will be your shopping paradise. 
Finally, It is a crowded city. In addition to the population of 6 billion people, there are thousands of people throughout VN coming here to live, work, and study. In general, this is a worth-living city.
