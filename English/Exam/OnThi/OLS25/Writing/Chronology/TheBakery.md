# Chronology - The Bakery

If you are eager to taste a sweet cake, the bakery is the place to be. In case you don't know where to find a good one, you should go on the internet and search for a good bakery. I recommend one of the most famous bakeries in Ho Chi Minh City – The Paris Baguette. Unless you know how to get there, you can search the location on Google Maps or ask a friend for more information.

When you arrive, if you drive a car, you should park your car in the designated parking area, usually located nearby or in an underground parking lot. If you ride a motorcycle, you may see a parking lot right next to the store; you should have your motorcycle kept there. The bakery's security guard will secure your motorcycle and give you a parking permit.

When you enter the bakery, the first thing you notice is the wonderland of cakes. There are many kinds of cakes showcased in refrigerated glass cases. The staff will greet you warmly and offer assistance. They might ask if you prefer sweet or savory cakes. If you're interested in savory cakes, they will suggest options like hotdogs, hamburgers, crispy cakes, dumplings, small pizzas, and ham and cheese sandwiches. If you are a fan of sweet cakes, you will find an array of delicious choices such as strawberry cakes, coconut cakes, fruit cakes, cheese tarts, egg tarts, chocolate mousse, and even intricately decorated wedding cakes.

If it’s your birthday, they might also ask you to write the message that will be decorated on the cake and provide candles shaped like numbers to illustrate the age. Once you’ve made your selections, you will proceed to the cashier to pay for your cakes. You might get a discount if there is a special event or promotion on that day. After paying, the cashier will give you a receipt and wish you a pleasant day.

If you don't go to Paris Baguette, there are many other excellent bakeries around the city. You can choose from Tour les Jours, BreadTalk, Savoure, or Kinh Do Bakery, but you may not find the same quality and variety of cakes as the place I recommended.

Before you leave, remember to check all your belongings, get your parking permit ticket, and prepare money for the parking fee. Then, you can head to the parking lot or basement to retrieve your vehicle. The security guard will take your ticket and fee, and you are free to go.

And finally, when you go home, if it’s a good bakery, you will remember it and refer it to your friends; you will keep its address in your phone book. But if it’s a bad one, you won’t refer it to your friends, and you won’t come back next time.
