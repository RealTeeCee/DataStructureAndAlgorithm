0# Why Like Traveling?

I love traveling to the beach. I like to go to the beach to enjoy my days off.
I often spend my summer vacation traveling to some famous beaches in VietNam. 
I have been to Nha Trang Beach, Mui Ne Beach, Phu Quoc Islands, and Da Nang Beach; they are so beautiful that they attract not only domestic but also international tourists. 
I usually use cars as a means of transportation for the trips because I frequently go with my family. If I go with my friends we will ride motorcycles so that we can observe the beauty of the surroundings. 
I will stay there for 3-4 days. There are many activities my family and I can do at the beach. For example, I can go swimming, sunbathing, scuba diving, surfing, and playing beach volleyball with my nephews or they can build sandcastles with the soft sand at the coast meanwhile my parents can enjoy seafood at the nearby restaurant with an ocean view.
I like to go to the beach as It makes me feel relaxed and energetic; additionally, it also can help me release my stress after a long and tiring working week.
