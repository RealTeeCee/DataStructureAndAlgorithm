I like to study E at Outeref because It is one the famous English Center for its teaching quality as well as its teaching staff.
The most special point here is the reflex method that creates the fastest results in the shortest time.
I study E here so that I can improve my E skills that I am able to communicate with foreign colleagues.
The teachers here is not only experieced but also devoted. They are always patient to explain lesson until students understand and grasp the lesson content. I have been studing E here with my brother for 6 months. I choose Dien Bien Phu Campus since It's near my home in order that I can save my time for moving.
I have studied a lot of skill at Outeref such as speaking, writing and more. At first, I felt English was so difficult that I wanted to give up. With the help of the teachers here, my English has gradually improved. I can now communicate and write emails in English although I need to keep trying. If I had known Outeref sooner, I wouldn't have wasted my time for learning English.
I hope after complete courses at Outeref I can speak E as if I were a native speaker. I will recommend Outeref to my friends who want to learn English.
