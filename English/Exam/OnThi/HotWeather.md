# What will you do when the weather is hot?
In the hot weather I will take a shower twice or three times a day because my body will sweat a lot and It will stink. 
I also have to drink more water to avoid dehydration of my body.
Second, I will turn on the AC all day even though I have to pay more for the electricity bill.
Third, If I have to go out I will head for airconditioned places like the coffee shop or the shopping mall.
Finally, If I want to travel somewhere to escape the heat I will definitely choose Dalat or Sapa I will stay there for a couple days to recharge my battery.
