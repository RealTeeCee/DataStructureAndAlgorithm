# Describe CoffeeShop
I would like to tell you about my favorite coffee shop. It's The Coffee House.
First, It's popular. You can find It anywhere In HCMC.
Second, It's beautiful. It has a luxury space. The theme colors are black and brown. So It attracts most mature people like office workers, teachers, college students. I really like to spend my time with my laptop here because the space offers a working atmosphere.
Third, The drinks are delicious. The Coffee House specializes in Coffee and Fruity tea so It can serves different types of customers. I particularly like peach tea with orange and lemon grass which cannot be found at any other coffee shops.
In general, the coffee house is an ideal place for working/studying/ or reading.
