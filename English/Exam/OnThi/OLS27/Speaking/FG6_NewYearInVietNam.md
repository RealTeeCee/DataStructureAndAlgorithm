New Year in Vietnam, particularly the Lunar New Year or Tết Nguyên Đán, is the most important celebration in the country. Although the spirit of Tết is shared nationwide, each region—north, central, and south—has its own unique traditions and customs that add to the richness of the holiday.

To begin with, in northern Vietnam, Tết is deeply rooted in tradition and formality. Families in this region prepare meticulously by cleaning their homes and decorating with peach blossoms (hoa đào) and kumquat trees (cây quất), which symbolize prosperity and happiness. Traditional foods like bánh chưng (square sticky rice cakes) are an essential part of the celebration, representing the Earth. During Tết, people often visit pagodas, offer incense, and pay respects to their ancestors to pray for a prosperous new year.

Moving to central Vietnam, Tết celebrations reflect a mix of simplicity and elegance. Families here also clean their homes and display flowers, but yellow apricot blossoms (hoa mai) are more common than peach blossoms. The central region is known for its variety of traditional dishes, including bánh tét (cylindrical sticky rice cakes) and pickled vegetables. Moreover, people place a strong emphasis on honoring their ancestors and visiting local shrines or pagodas to show gratitude and hope for blessings in the coming year.

In contrast, the southern region of Vietnam celebrates Tết with a more relaxed and festive atmosphere. Like in the central region, yellow apricot blossoms are a popular decoration, along with watermelon and red envelopes (bao lì xì) for children, symbolizing good fortune. The south is famous for its bustling markets and colorful street decorations during Tết. Families gather to enjoy traditional dishes like thịt kho hột vịt (braised pork with eggs) and sweet treats, while also taking time to visit friends and neighbors to exchange new year greetings.

In conclusion, New Year in Vietnam is celebrated with shared cultural values of family, gratitude, and hope, yet each region adds its own distinct flavor to the holiday. From the formal and traditional customs in the north to the festive and lively atmosphere in the south, Tết unites the Vietnamese people in welcoming a fresh start with joy and optimism.
