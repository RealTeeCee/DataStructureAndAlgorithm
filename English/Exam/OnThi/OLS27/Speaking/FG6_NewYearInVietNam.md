New Year in Vietnam, especially the Lunar New Year, or Tết Nguyên Đán, is the most important celebration in the country. While the spirit of Tết is felt everywhere, each region—north, central, and south—has its own unique traditions that make the holiday even more special.

Let’s start with the north. In northern Vietnam, Tết is all about tradition and respect for customs. Families clean their homes, decorate with peach blossoms and kumquat trees, which represent prosperity and happiness. One of the most important foods is bánh chưng, a square sticky rice cake symbolizing the Earth. During Tết, people visit pagodas, burn incense, and honor their ancestors, praying for a lucky and successful year ahead.

Moving to central Vietnam, Tết here is a mix of elegance and simplicity. Families also clean and decorate their homes, but instead of peach blossoms, yellow apricot flowers are common. The food is diverse and delicious, with bánh tét—cylindrical sticky rice cakes—and pickled vegetables being traditional favorites. The people here really focus on honoring their ancestors too, by visiting shrines and pagodas, expressing gratitude, and hoping for good things in the year to come.

And then, there’s the south. Tết in the southern region has a more relaxed, festive atmosphere. Yellow apricot blossoms are still popular, and you’ll also see watermelons and red envelopes, or “bao lì xì,” given to children for good luck. The markets are lively, the streets are decorated with bright colors, and families gather to enjoy dishes like thịt kho hột vịt (braised pork with eggs) and sweets. People also visit friends and neighbors to exchange new year wishes, filling the streets with joy and excitement.

In the end, Tết in Vietnam is a celebration of family, gratitude, and hope. No matter if you’re in the north, central region, or the south, it’s about coming together, honoring traditions, and welcoming the new year with positivity and joy. Each region adds its own unique touch, making Tết a truly special and unifying holiday.
