Lunar New Year, or Tết, is Vietnam's most important celebration, with unique traditions in the north, central, and southern regions.

In the north, Tết focuses on tradition. Families clean their homes, decorate with peach blossoms and kumquat trees, and prepare bánh chưng, symbolizing the Earth. Visits to pagodas and ancestor worship are key to praying for a lucky year.

Central Vietnam celebrates with elegance. Homes are decorated with yellow apricot flowers, and traditional foods like bánh tét and pickled vegetables are enjoyed. Families honor ancestors and express gratitude at shrines and pagodas.

In the south, Tết is festive and lively. Yellow apricot blossoms, watermelons, and lucky money (lì xì) bring joy. Families gather for dishes like thịt kho hột vịt and sweets, while markets and streets buzz with celebration.

Tết unites Vietnam through family, gratitude, and hope, with each region adding its own special touch.
