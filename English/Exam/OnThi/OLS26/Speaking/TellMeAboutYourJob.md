# Nguyen

Hello, my name is Nguyen, and I’m a Software Engineer currently working at Manulife Plaza in District 7. In my role, I focus on building and maintaining software applications that support our company's operations. While my official hours are from 8 AM to 5:30 PM, I often stay until 6:15 PM to provide additional support to business users who rely on our software.

My responsibilities include designing and implementing efficient code, collaborating closely with cross-functional teams, and ensuring that our applications deliver an excellent user experience. I’m involved in diverse tasks across different teams and departments, such as developing APIs, enhancing front-end features, and optimizing database queries. These efforts have led to improved application performance, higher user satisfaction, and cost savings for the company.

Currently, I’m expanding my skills by learning new programming languages and technology frameworks. I’m eager to apply this knowledge to my work and continually improve my contributions. I strive to grow every day as a professional and aim to make a meaningful impact on the projects I work on
