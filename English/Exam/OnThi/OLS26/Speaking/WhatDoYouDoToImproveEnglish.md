To improve my English, I follow several effective learning strategies. 
First, I plan to enroll in a reputable English language center to receive structured learning. Attending every class consistently is crucial, and I make sure to review each lesson thoroughly, focusing on both vocabulary and grammar, while completing all assignments being given. 
Second, In addition to classroom learning, I actively seek out high-quality online resources to enhance my understanding beyond the school curriculum. 
Third, I usually prioritize practicing English every day by creating opportunities to engage with my colleagues, friends, and teachers. 
Finally, I also participate in English clubs to increase my chances of interacting with native speakers and improving my conversational skills. By combining formal education with self-driven practice, I aim to make significant progress in mastering the language.
