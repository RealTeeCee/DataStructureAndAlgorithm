# 1 Job, Significant event
I am a software engineer working for Manulife Vietnam. My working hours start at 9 AM and end at 5:30 PM. My daily tasks include attending a morning meeting to report on the previous day's work and plan for the current day; participating in software development; guiding and supporting other team members; and handling issues related to the company’s software system. Last year, I was chosen to be the lead engineer for the online payment project, which made me very happy because this work allowed me to bring more value to the company. At the same time, I felt anxious due to my limited experience in this new role, but fortunately, I received a lot of support from my colleagues. In the end, the project was successful.
# 2 What do you need to do if you want to learn English well
If you want to learn English well, there several things you can consider:

1. Set Clear Goals: Decide why you want to learn English—whether for travel, work, or personal interest.
2. Take a Course: enrolling in a class, either online or in-person, for structured learning.
3. Expand Your Vocabulary and Grammar : Learn new words daily, and try to use them in sentences. Understand the rules, but don’t let them hold you back from speaking. Use grammar exercises to reinforce your knowledge.
4. Practice: Find language exchange partners, join conversation clubs, or practice speaking with friends. Engage with English media—podcasts, movies, TV shows, and music. This helps with pronunciation and understanding.
