# 1 Job, Significant event
I am a software engineer working for Manulife Vietnam. My working hours start at 9 AM and end at 5:30 PM. My daily tasks include attending the morning meeting to report on the previous day's work and plan for the current day; participating in software development; guiding and supporting other team members; and addressing issues related to the company's software systems. Last year, I was chosen as the lead engineer for the online payment project, which made me very happy because this role allowed me to bring more value to the company. At the same time, I also felt anxious due to my limited experience in this new role, but fortunately, I received a lot of support from my colleagues. Throughout the project, my team faced many challenges and a few system errors, but we managed to overcome them. However, there was one issue related to the system that our team did not anticipate; it occurred silently, and we didn't realize it until users generated reports. This incident affected thousands of the company's agents, and we had to address it as soon as possible. Unfortunately, my team was unable to resolve it on our own. I had to seek help from more experienced engineers for the issue to be resolved. I learned many lessons from that incident for future projects. Despite the challenges, the project ultimately ended successfully.
# 2 What do you need to do if you want to learn English well
If you want to learn English well, there several things you can consider:

1. Set Clear Goals: Decide why you want to learn English—whether for travel, work, or personal interest.
2. Take a Course: enrolling in a class, either online or in-person, for structured learning.
3. Expand Your Vocabulary and Grammar : Learn new words daily, and try to use them in sentences. Understand the rules, but don’t let them hold you back from speaking. Use grammar exercises to reinforce your knowledge.
4. Practice: Find language exchange partners, join conversation clubs, or practice speaking with friends. Engage with English media—podcasts, movies, TV shows, and music. This helps with pronunciation and understanding.
