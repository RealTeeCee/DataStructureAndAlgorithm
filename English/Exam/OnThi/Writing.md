# Describe your teacher

I have had many important people in my entire life and I admire my teacher the most because he is experienced, dedicated, punctual, and friendly. I respect him because of his character and I have learned a lot from him.

First, he is an experienced teacher. He has been teaching English for over 16 years. He has taught various groups of students such as children, teenagers, adolescents, university students, and adults. He employs multiple effective teaching methods. He can teach a lesson in different ways. For example, when teaching vocabulary, he uses body language, illustrated drawings, translation, and more. As a result, students don't feel bored in his class.

Second, he is a dedicated teacher. He teaches every detail of the lesson. He explains the lesson by demonstration. He always cares about the academic performance of his students. Weaker students receive extra guidance from him to catch up with the class. He usually corrects students' mistakes in class and explains by giving examples. He often stays up late to prepare the lesson plans before the lecture.

And finally, he is impressively punctual. He has never been late before, thanks to the alarm function in his luxury smartwatch. He has never kept me waiting. He wakes up early every morning to correct students homework. He has a great time management skill.

In conclusion, he is an excellent teacher. I always admired what he did as a teacher. Thanks to him, many generations of students have succeeded in their learning.
