1. Are you used to getting up early?
Yes, I'm used to getting up early. There are numerous benefits of getting up early. I get up early every morning so that I can do exercise which will help my body feel healthy. Moreover, It also offers a lot of advantages, including the ability to eat healthier, avoid peak traffic, reduce stress levels, have higher morning energy, increase happiness, and do my best work at the start of my workday. In spite of the fact that it might be hard to wake up daily at 5 AM, as long as I remind myself of these benefits I will get up and do it.   

2. Are you used to eating dinner late?
No, I'm not used to eating dinner late. If you make late-night snacking a regular habit, it could have unintended consequences on your health. Eating dinner late not only leads to weight gain, and obesity easily but also causes many other health issues. Therefore, I dare not to eat after 8 PM for fear that I would gain weight and have high blood pressure.

3. When are you going to come back?
I will come back as soon as possible. Because of the nature of the job, I have to work far away from home. As long as I know what I'm doing and keep doing it I will finish it and come back. Even though it is hard to complete the task when I don't know anybody here to guide me in doing it, I will try my best. Therefore, I promise that I will come back before June.
