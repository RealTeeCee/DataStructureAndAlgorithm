People in my area like this bank very much. It is very convenient despite the fact that it's small.

Look! This is the lobby; the security man is standing by the door to keep the order. Many customers are waiting in line to be served; some children are playing on the sofas as they are waiting for their parents; the clock is running; everybody is working. There are a lot of customers; some are making deposits; some are cashing checks; others are withdrawing money; and still others are asking the tellers for the balance of their accounts. About twelve tellers are serving the customers. One teller is selling a money order to an old man; another is accepting a lot of money for a deposit from a rich businessman; and another is talking to an angry customer about the service.
