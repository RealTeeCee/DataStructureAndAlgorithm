If you are eager to taste a sweet cake, the bakery is the place to be. 

In case you don't know where to find a good one, you should go on the internet and search for a good bakery. I recommend one of the most famous bakeries in Ho Chi Minh City - The Paris Baguette. 

Unless you know how to go there, you can search the location on Google Maps or you can ask a friend for more information.

When you arrive there, if you drive a car you should park your car in the basement. If you ride a motorcycle you may see the parking lot right next to the store; you should have your motorcycle kept there. The bakery's security guard keeps your motorcycle and gives you a parking permit.

When you enter the bakery, the first thing come across is the wonderland of cake. There are many kinds of cakes showcased in refrigerated glass cases. And their staff will greet you. They will show you and give you some advice about your ideal cake. Firstly, She will ask if you want a sweet cake or a salty cake. If you are interested in salty cake, they will offer you some cakes like hotdogs, hamburgers, crispy cakes, dumplings, small pizzas, ham and cheese sandwiches, etc. If you are a fan of sweet cakes, there are strawberry cakes, coconut cakes, fruit cakes, cheese tarts, egg tarts, chocolate mousse, or even wedding cakes will some icing and frosting decorated on them. If it is your birthday, she might also need you to write the letter that will be decorated on the cake, and then give you some candles with a number's shape to illustrate the age. Finally, you have to go to the cashier and pay for those cakes. You will have a chance to be discounted if it's have special event on that day. and after that, she will give you a receipt and wish you the have a nice meal.

If you don't go to the Paris Baguette, there are a lot of bakeries around the town. You can choose Tour les jour, BreadTalk, Savoure or Kinh Do bakery but you won't find the same cake with the same quality as the place I recommended.

Before you leave there, remember to check all the kinds of stuff, get the parking permit ticket, and prepare money for the parking fee. Then you can go right to the parking lot or the basement to get your vehicle then the security guard will get your ticket and fee and you are free to go.

And finally, When you go home. If it's a good bakery, you will remember it and you will refer it to your friends; you will keep its address in your telephone book. But if it's a bad one, you won't refer it to your friend and you won't come back next time.
