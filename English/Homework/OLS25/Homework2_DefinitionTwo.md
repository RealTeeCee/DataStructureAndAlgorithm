1. At the Zoo
Today, We visited the zoo, and it was awesome. We saw lions, tiger, and bears, and i got to feed the giraffes. Mom took tons of photos, and I can't wait to show them to my friends at school. It was like being in a jungle advanture.
1. At the Beach
Yesterday, we had a super fun day at the beach, Mom packed a delicious picnic, and we played beach volleyball, built sandcastles, and splashed around in the waves. I even found a shiny seashell to keep as a souvenir. It was the day ever.
1. My favorite toy
One day, I lost my favorite toy at the park. I was sad. But then a kind lady found it and gave it to the park's office. My dad called, and they said they had it. I was relieved and happy when i got it back. It taugh me to be careful with my things.
1. My Pet
I have a pet dog named Max. He is a brown and white Labrador. Every day, i take Max for a walk in the park. He loves chasing his ball and playing with other dogs. After our walk, I give Max his dinner. He likes eating chicken and rice. Max is my best friend.
1. My Moring
Every morning, I wake up at 5 o'clock. I get out of bed and wash my face. Then, I brush my teeth and comb my hair. After that, I prepare and have breakfast. I usually eat cereal with milk and apple. Then, I put on my company uniform and pack my backpack. I say goodbye to my parents and to the bus sotp. I catch the bus to my office at 8 o'clock.
1. Camping
Last week, my family and I went camping in the woods. We set up our tent, made a campfire, and roasted marshmallows. My father even taugh me how to fish in the lake near by. It was so cool sleeping under the stars, listening to the sound of nature. I can't wait for our next advanture.
1. My dinner
Gathered around the dinner table, my family shares laughter and stories. Delicious aromas fill the air as we enjoy homemade dishes passed down through generations. The warmth of togetherness wraps around us, creating cherished memories. After dessert, we gather for games and lively conversation, savoring every moment of our time together.
1. My day
Each morning, I wake up to my alarm and hit the gym for a workout. At work, I stay focused, taking breaks as needed. In the evening, I enjoy a stroll in the park before relaxing at home with a book or TV show. Then, I prepare for bed, ensuring a peaceful night's sleep to recharge for the next day.
1. A teacher
He is a techer. He teachs third graders. He say "good morning" every day. He ask his students how they are doing. The student love him. He is good at his job. He does not get a lot of money. Still, he love his job. Teacher deserve more respect and love.
1.  My part-time job
I work part-time at the reception so mainly I have to pass the incoming calls to the company, then I receive visitors with appointments, and I also deal with general enquiries by phone or by customers actually coming to the company. There are a lot of those you'd be supprised.
