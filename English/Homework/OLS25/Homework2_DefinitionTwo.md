# Lesson 2

1. We bought a new car yesterday. I drove around Ho Chi Minh City yesterday evening and people looked admiringly at me. Everybody likes it a lot because it looks very luxurious and expensive. From now on, I won't have to catch a bus to go to work anymore. I also can travel to any place I want.

2. The school has opened some new English classes. I brought my sister to learn with me. I and my sister have been introduced to a lot of friends lately. I also told my relatives to come to visit and learn English with me if they have free time. In the class, some students speak English very well.

3. I'm a student. I go to Outeref at least twice a week to learn English, especially about speaking skills. I have to do and turn in my homework on time every week. Besides, I was also a student at an information technology school. I'm capable of writing a program and running it well.

4. I'm a clerk. I have been working for an insurance company for over 10 years. I have to answer the phone every day from 8 AM to 5.30 PM. I often file all the records in my department. I will photocopy all the reports on my boss's table right after he needs them. I also represent the director when he is absent. I served a wide range of customers from easy-going to difficult.

5. My friend is sick. Me and his mother have taken him to the hospital since he vomited in the class. The form teacher said that he would not go to school for at least 2 weeks. After recovering from a bad illness, he stayed at home for a few days. He has to take medications three times a day after each meal to prevent the sickness from coming back. 

6. I feel sad. I don't want to see my coach. I want to go out with my friends and I want to listen to music at a concert with them. I'm feeling really tired at the moment, I want to drop off to sleep right away

7. My girlfriend sent me a love letter. She said she loved me even though I looked fat, ugly, and short. She wants me to apologize to her when she did something wrong. She would be angry if I said she was wrong. The only thing that makes her happy is when I take out my wallet at the dining restaurant.

8. My parents showed me the book. They asked me to read it out loud because they hardly hear it if I said too small. The book is about a man who travels to the pyramids of Egypt to find a treasure he has recurrently dreamed about. It is The Alchemist - a famous book that has a lot of helpful value.

9. Don't make her cry. She is just a little innocent girl. she will have to go to school tomorrow alone without her father. She didn't steal anything from that fat rich old man. Don't ever say she's a thief, she knew nothing about it. 

10. My boss has me study computers for a B degree in information technology. Even though I graduated from the best school in technology, I have never been good at Microsoft Excel and Microsoft Word. One reason is that I want to do the harder work which uses grey matter not just typing and sorting rows and columns. I want to be a great Software Engineer, not a boring typist.

1. At the Zoo
Today, We visited the zoo, and it was awesome. We saw lions, tiger, and bears, and i got to feed the giraffes. Mom took tons of photos, and I can't wait to show them to my friends at school. It was like being in a jungle advanture.

Yesterday, we had a super fun day at the beach, Mom packed a delicious picnic, and we played beach volleyball, built sandcastles, and splashed around in the waves. I even found a shiny seashell to keep as a souvenir. It was the day ever.
1. My favorite toy
One day, I lost my favorite toy at the park. I was sad. But then a kind lady found it and gave it to the park's office. My dad called, and they said they had it. I was relieved and happy when i got it back. It taugh me to be careful with my things.
1. My Pet

1. My Moring
Every morning, I wake up at 5 o'clock. I get out of bed and wash my face. Then, I brush my teeth and comb my hair. After that, I prepare and have breakfast. I usually eat cereal with milk and apple. Then, I put on my company uniform and pack my backpack. I say goodbye to my parents and to the bus sotp. I catch the bus to my office at 8 o'clock.
1. Camping
Last week, my family and I went camping in the woods. We set up our tent, made a campfire, and roasted marshmallows. My father even taugh me how to fish in the lake near by. It was so cool sleeping under the stars, listening to the sound of nature. I can't wait for our next advanture.
1. My dinner
Gathered around the dinner table, my family shares laughter and stories. Delicious aromas fill the air as we enjoy homemade dishes passed down through generations. The warmth of togetherness wraps around us, creating cherished memories. After dessert, we gather for games and lively conversation, savoring every moment of our time together.
1. My day
Each morning, I wake up to my alarm and hit the gym for a workout. At work, I stay focused, taking breaks as needed. In the evening, I enjoy a stroll in the park before relaxing at home with a book or TV show. Then, I prepare for bed, ensuring a peaceful night's sleep to recharge for the next day.
1. A teacher
He is a techer. He teachs third graders. He say "good morning" every day. He ask his students how they are doing. The student love him. He is good at his job. He does not get a lot of money. Still, he love his job. Teacher deserve more respect and love.
1.  My part-time job
I work part-time at the reception so mainly I have to pass the incoming calls to the company, then I receive visitors with appointments, and I also deal with general enquiries by phone or by customers actually coming to the company. There are a lot of those you'd be supprised.
