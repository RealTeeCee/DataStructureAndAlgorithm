1. We bought a new car yesterday. I drove around Ho Chi Minh City yesterday evening and people looked admiringly at me. Everybody likes it a lot because it looks very luxurious and expensive. From now on, I won't have to catch a bus to go to work anymore. I also can travel to any place I want.

2. The school has opened some new English classes. I brought my sister to learn with me. I and my sister have been introduced to a lot of friends lately. I also told my relatives to come to visit and learn English with me if they have free time. In the class, some students speak English very well.

3. I'm a student. I go to Outeref at least twice a week to learn English, especially about speaking skills. I have to do and turn in my homework on time every week. Besides, I was also a student at an information technology school. I'm capable of writing a program and running it well.

4. I'm a clerk. I have been working for an insurance company for over 10 years. I have to answer the phone every day from 8 AM to 5.30 PM. I often file all the records in my department. I will photocopy all the reports on my boss's table right after he needs them. I also represent the director when he is absent. I served a wide range of customers from easy-going to difficult.

5. My friend is sick. Me and his mother have taken him to the hospital since he vomited in the class. The form teacher said that he would not go to school for at least 2 weeks. After recovering from a bad illness, he stayed at home for a few days. He has to take medications three times a day after each meal to prevent the sickness from coming back. 

6. I feel sad. I don't want to see my coach. I want to go out with my friends and I want to listen to music at a concert with them. I'm feeling really tired at the moment, I want to drop off to sleep right away

7. My girlfriend sent me a love letter. She said she loved me even though I looked fat, ugly, and short. She wants me to apologize to her when she did something wrong. She would be angry if I said she was wrong. The only thing that makes her happy is when I take out my wallet at the dining restaurant.

8. My parents showed me the book. They asked me to read it out loud because they hardly hear it if I said too small. The book is about a man who travels to the pyramids of Egypt to find a treasure he has recurrently dreamed about. It is The Alchemist - a famous book that has a lot of helpful value.

9. Don't make her cry. She is just a little innocent girl. she will have to go to school tomorrow alone without her father. She didn't steal anything from that fat rich old man. Don't ever say she's a thief, she knew nothing about it. 

10. My boss has me study computers for a B degree in information technology. Even though I graduated from the best school in technology, I have never been good at Microsoft Excel and Microsoft Word. One reason is that I want to do the harder work which uses grey matter not just typing and sorting rows and columns. I want to be a great Software Engineer, not a type-machined clerk.
