* Post Office
Let me introduce the historic landmark located in the heart of Ho Chi Minh City, The Saigon Central Post Office. 
First, it's an old post office. It is located in downtown Ho Chi Minh City, near the Saigon Notre-Dame Basilica, and was built between 1886 and 1891. My grandfather has been using its services for over 50 years.
Second, it's a convenient post office. Currently, my parents mailing letters here because they know that the entire process is incredibly simple. they bought stamps just 5 minutes ago at the grocery store next door. A lot of people come here to make long-distance calls every day. It also has a telegram-sending service and money-wiring service although people might prefer to use the online methods more.
In conclusion, It's the best post office in HCM city. I will come here soon. If you haven't used the post office in there, you should come and take a trial.
