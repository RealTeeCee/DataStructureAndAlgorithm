I had always been a bit on the heavier side and preferred spending my free time lying on the couch rather than engaging in physical activities. At the end of 2020, I started to read a memoir book called "What I Talk About When I Talk About Running" by Haruki Murakami. After finishing the book at the beginning of 2021, I decided to make a big change in my lifestyle and start running to improve my fitness. 

I had never been much of a runner, but that morning I felt particularly motivated. As I ran, I found myself pushing harder than I should have. By the time I reached 2 km mark, my legs were aching, and my breath was gasping heavily. I wished I had paced myself better. Despite the discomfort, I kept going until I finally finished the 3 km run. Almost immediately, a wave of nausea hit me. I fell to the grass next to the side of the path where I vomited several times. Other joggers passed by, some offering concerned looks, but I was too embarrassed to make eye contact. After all, I had been pushing myself too hard at that time. 

It has been a while, I still kept running day by day. Now, I can run 10 km without feeling tired at all. My friend said that he would begin running just like me one day.

On my first day at work, I arrived early and met my new colleagues. I attended orientation sessions and learned about company policies. I started to feel excited about my new role. When I arrived, everyone was busy preparing for the day. I was meeting new people and trying to remember everyone's names. The HR manager was explaining company benefits while I was setting up my workstation. By the time I had finished orientation, I had already met most of my team members. I had received my access badge before the meeting started. I had been eagerly anticipating my first day at work for weeks. By the time I arrived, I had been researching the company and preparing for the role for months. I knew that on my first day at work, I would meet a lot of new people and learn a great deal about the company. I was sure I would feel nervous and excited at the same time.
