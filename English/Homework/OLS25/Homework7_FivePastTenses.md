# Lesson 7
# Nguyen

I had always been a bit on the heavier side and preferred spending my free time lying on the couch rather than engaging in physical activities. At the end of 2020, I started to read a memoir book called "What I Talk About When I Talk About Running" by Haruki Murakami. After finishing the book at the beginning of 2021, I decided to make a big change in my lifestyle and start running to improve my fitness. 

I had never been much of a runner, but that morning I felt particularly motivated. As I ran, I found myself pushing harder than I should have. By the time I reached 2 km mark, my legs were aching, and my breath was gasping heavily. I wished I had paced myself better. Despite the discomfort, I kept going until I finally finished the 3 km run. Almost immediately, a wave of nausea hit me. I fell to the grass next to the side of the path where I vomited several times. Other joggers passed by, some offering concerned looks, but I was too embarrassed to make eye contact. After all, I had been pushing myself too hard at that time. 

It has been a while, I still kept running day by day. Now, I can run 10 km without feeling tired at all. My friend said that he would begin running just like me one day.
