Let me introduce to my best friend Andy. He is 30 years old and currently working for ABC company as a Software Engineer. He has been working there for 3 years recently. However, he said that he would switch his job next month.
As for me, he is an intelligent man. He had many brilliant ideas for his TikTok video. He has owned these channels for 1 year and they earned more than 1 million subscribes.

Today, I like to tell you about my co-worker. Her name is TA. She is working for teachnology company as a project manager.  She have worked there for 2 years. She joined the company two months after me. Even though we work in the same department, I didn't know her until we participated in the same project last year.  This project will complete in next month, however she have been joining another project recently. She is intelligent and has a high sense of responsibility. I'm happy to have the opportunity to work with her.
