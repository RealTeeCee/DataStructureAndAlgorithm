Today, I like to tell you about my co-worker. Her name is TA. She is working for technology company as a project manager.  She has worked there for 2 years. She joined the company two months after me. Even though we work in the same department, I didn't know her until we participated in the same project last year.  This project will complete in next month, however she has been joining another project recently. She is intelligent and has a high sense of responsibility. I'm happy to have the opportunity to work with her.
