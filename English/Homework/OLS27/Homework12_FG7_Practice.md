# Topic 26: Household appliances
In the past, household chores required manual effort, like washing clothes by hand and cooking over wood stoves. The invention of electricity brought early appliances like irons and refrigerators in the early 20th century, which reduced labor but were expensive and limited to wealthy families. Over time, mass production made these appliances more affordable and widespread.

Today, household appliances are smart, efficient, and time-saving. Washing machines, microwaves, and robotic vacuums handle chores with ease. Smart devices connected to the internet allow remote control, like adjusting air conditioners or programming coffee makers, making life more convenient and comfortable.

In the future, appliances will become even smarter and more sustainable. AI-powered devices will learn user habits, suggest recipes, or restock groceries automatically. Energy-efficient and eco-friendly appliances, like solar-powered refrigerators, will reduce environmental impact, while multifunctional and autonomous devices will simplify daily tasks further.

From labor-intensive chores to smart, connected devices, household appliances have revolutionized daily life. As technology advances, future appliances will bring even greater convenience, sustainability, and innovation, making home life easier than ever.

# Topic 27: The Internet
The Past
The internet began in the 1960s as a military project called ARPANET, designed to share information between computers. In the 1980s, it expanded to universities and research institutions, allowing scientists to exchange data. By the 1990s, the World Wide Web was invented, bringing websites, emails, and online communication to everyday users. Early internet connections were slow and limited, but they marked the beginning of a global revolution.

Today, the internet is a crucial part of modern life. It connects billions of people worldwide, enabling instant communication, online shopping, education, and entertainment. High-speed broadband and mobile data allow users to stream videos, work remotely, and stay connected from anywhere. Social media platforms, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence have transformed how we interact, work, and learn, making the internet indispensable in daily life.

In the future, the internet is expected to become faster, more immersive, and even more integrated into our lives. Technologies like 5G, the Internet of Things (IoT), and artificial intelligence will connect devices seamlessly, from smart homes to self-driving cars. Virtual and augmented reality will create more interactive experiences, and global internet access will help bridge the digital divide, connecting even the most remote areas.

The internet has evolved from a tool for researchers to a vital part of modern society. It has transformed communication, education, and business, and its future promises even greater advancements, making our world more connected and innovative than ever.

# Topic 28: The Olympic Games
The Past
The Olympic Games began in ancient Greece around 776 BCE as a celebration of athleticism and unity among Greek city-states. These games were held every four years in Olympia and featured events like running, wrestling, and chariot racing. After being banned in 393 CE, the Olympics disappeared for centuries until they were revived in 1896 in Athens, becoming a modern international competition. Early modern Olympics had limited participation, mostly from European countries, and far fewer events compared to today.

Today, the Olympic Games are the worldâ€™s largest sporting event, bringing together athletes from nearly every country. Held every four years, with Summer and Winter Games alternating, the Olympics showcase a wide range of sports, from traditional events like track and swimming to newer ones like skateboarding and climbing. Advances in technology, like instant replays and online streaming, allow millions of fans to watch the games live. The Olympics also promote values of friendship, respect, and global unity, despite occasional controversies surrounding politics, doping, or costs.

In the future, the Olympics are likely to embrace even more technological innovation. Virtual reality and augmented reality could enhance the viewing experience, making it more interactive for fans. Sustainability will also play a bigger role, with host cities using renewable energy and eco-friendly infrastructure. Additionally, new sports and formats may be introduced to keep the games relevant to younger generations, ensuring their global appeal.

From their ancient beginnings in Greece to the global celebration they are today, the Olympic Games have evolved tremendously. They continue to inspire athletes and unite people worldwide, and their future promises exciting advancements while upholding the spirit of competition and unity.
