# The Restaurant
Part A:
If I go to a restaurant to eat dinner, I will choose Phong Cua which is a seafood restaurant near my house.
I will book the reservation which has the position near the riverbank.
I will go there with a group of men that are my friends.
I will be greeted by the staffs and they will show me the way which lead to my reserved table.
I will choose the signature dish of the restaurant which is curry crab.
Then I will pay the cashier and leave some tips. 

Part B:
But If I went to a restaurant to work, I wouldn't go to a restaurant to eat dinner. I wouldn't choose Phong Cua which is a seafood restaurant near my house. 
I wouldn't book the reservation which has the position near the riverbank. I wouldn't go there with a group of men that are my friends. 
I wouldn't be greeted by the staffs and they wouldn't show me the way which lead to my reserved table.
I wouldn't choose the signature dish of the restaurant which is curry crab.
Then I wouldn't pay the cashier and leave some tips.
