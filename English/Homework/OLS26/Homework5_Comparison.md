Topic: Take your children to a public park in the city
Part A:
If you want to take your children to a public park in the city, you will have to ride your motorcycle which is full of gasoline. 
You will take them to the parking lot where you will find a security guard to give you a parking permit. 
Then you will search for the location that suits kids.
You will see the place where a lot of kids play.

Part B:
But If my friend Tom took his children to a park in the city, he wouldn't ride his motorcycle which is full of gasoline.
He wouldn't take them to the parking lot where he found a security guard to give him a parking permit. 
Then he wouldn't search for the location which suits for kids.
He wouldn't see the place where many kids are playing.
