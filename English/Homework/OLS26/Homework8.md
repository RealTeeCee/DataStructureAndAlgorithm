Last month, I visited Vũng Tàu Beach with my family. We arrived at the beach around 8 AM after a two-hour drive. The sun was shining brightly, and the sea breeze was refreshing. We quickly set up our beach towels and umbrellas near the shoreline. My younger sister ran to the water and started swimming, while my parents relaxed under the shade. I joined her a few minutes later, diving into the cool water. After a while, we built sandcastles, played beach volleyball, and took many photos together. Around noon, we had a seafood lunch at a nearby restaurant. The food was delicious, especially the grilled prawns and clams. After lunch, we took a walk along the beach, enjoying the peaceful atmosphere before heading home.

But if I hadn't visited Vũng Tàu Beach with my family, we wouldn't have arrived at the beach around 8 AM after a two-hour drive. The sun wouldn't have been shining brightly, and the sea breeze wouldn't have been refreshing. We wouldn't have set up our beach towels and umbrellas near the shoreline. My younger sister wouldn't have run to the water, and I wouldn't have joined her a few minutes later. We wouldn't have built sandcastles, played beach volleyball, or taken many photos together. We wouldn't have had a seafood lunch at a nearby restaurant, and the grilled prawns and clams wouldn't have been so delicious. Finally, we wouldn't have taken a walk along the beach and wouldn't have enjoyed the peaceful atmosphere before heading home.
