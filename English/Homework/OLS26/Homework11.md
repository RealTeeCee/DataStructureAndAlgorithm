Dear Mr/Mrs Director,

I came across your Facebook post about the scholarship offer for the best students of the year. I hold an IELTS certificate with a score of 9.0, and I am very interested in applying for the English scholarship. I would like to take the exam to have the opportunity to receive this scholarship.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely Yours,

Re: Scholarship Application Response

Dear Tom Cruise,

I am pleased to have received your letter dated October 10, 2024, and I must say your IELTS score is truly impressive. While we have only 10 scholarships to award, we have received over 500 applications. All applicants will be notified of the examination date, and we will select the top 10 students based on the following criteria: educational background, achievements, expectations, and competitive exam results. After this process, I will arrange an appointment for an interview with the final candidates.

I ask that all students be patient throughout this process, and I will be awaiting your reply via mail. I encourage you to continue reviewing your lessons in preparation for the exam.

Thank you for your application, and best regards,

Mr. Director

Director of the Department of Scholarships
