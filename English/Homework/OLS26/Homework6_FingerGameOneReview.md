When you get there, you should first purchase your ticket at the entrance. If it’s crowded, you must wait in line. While waiting, you should review the zoo map or guide to plan your visit. Then you should explore the various animal exhibits, paying attention to feeding times or special shows. As you move through the zoo, make sure to follow the rules, like not feeding the animals or staying behind barriers.

When you go home, if it’s a good zoo with clean facilities and well-cared-for animals, you will likely return for another visit and won’t forget to recommend it to your friends.

# The University

If it’s a busy day, you might have to wait to meet with an advisor or join a group tour.

Then, you should attend any scheduled information sessions, speak with faculty members, and gather details about courses and extracurricular activities.

When you go home, if it’s a good university with a supportive environment and strong academic programs, you will be excited to apply and won’t hesitate to recommend it to your friends.

You should head to the most popular exhibits first to avoid long lines later in the day. If you want take photos you should capture photos of the animals and surroundings while it’s still early and not too crowded. You can also browse through the gift shops for souvenirs or any unique items you might want.
