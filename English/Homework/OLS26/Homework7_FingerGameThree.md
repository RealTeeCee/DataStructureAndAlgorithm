1. You took your best friend to the most expensive restaurant in your area
Last week, I took my best friend to the most expensive restaurant in my area. I arrived at his house with my old motorcycle. I waited for him from 6 PM to 6:15 PM. He walked out of his house with a cool outfit. Then we went to the place. At that moment, my stomach was yelling because I was so hungry. Stepping into the restaurant, we met the staff first. He asked us whether we had made a reservation and we replied that we hadn't booked yet. Then they led us to the vacant table. Looking at the menu, I ordered a medium rare T-shaped steak, and my friend asked if it was well done. We also needed a red wine to go with our dishes. In just about 15 minutes, Dinner was served. The steaks were perfect, soft, and flavorful. Both of us liked the dishes very much. We gave our compliments to the chefs through the staff then finished our meal and went home after paying the cashier and left some tips.

But If I had not taken my best friend to the most expensive restaurant in my area I wouldn't have arrived at his house with my old motorcycle and I wouldn't have waited for him from 6 PM to 6:15 PM. He wouldn't have walked out of his house with a cool outfit. Then we wouldn't have gone to the place. At that moment, my stomach wouldn't have been yelling because of hunger. we wouldn't have met the staff and he wouldn't have asked us whether we had made a reservation and we wouldn't have replied that we hadn't booked yet. Then they wouldn't have led us to the vacant table. I wouldn't have ordered a medium rare T-shaped steak, and my friend wouldn't have asked if it was well done. We also wouldn't have needed a red wine to go with our dishes. We wouldn't have given our compliments to the chefs through the staff, and then we wouldn't have finished our meal and wouldn't have gone home after paying the cashier and leaving some tips.

2. You and your classmates went on a vacation by bus
Last month, my classmates and I went on a vacation by bus. I arrived at the bus stop with my small travel bag at 7 AM. I waited for my friends from 7 AM to 7:20 AM. They showed up, full of excitement and energy. Then we boarded the bus. At that moment, I was so eager for the trip to begin. Once on the bus, the driver greeted us and asked if we were ready for the adventure. We all cheered. After about two hours, we stopped at a roadside café. I ordered a sandwich, and my classmate ordered coffee. Then we continued the trip. In another hour, we arrived at our destination. The views were stunning, and we spent the day exploring, taking pictures, and having fun. After an amazing day, we got back on the bus and returned home, feeling tired but happy.

But if my classmates and I hadn't gone on a vacation by bus, I wouldn't have arrived at the bus stop with my small travel bag at 7 AM. I wouldn't have waited for my friends from 7 AM to 7:20 AM, and they wouldn't have shown up with excitement. Then we wouldn't have boarded the bus. At that moment, I wouldn't have been eager for the trip. The driver wouldn't have greeted us or asked if we were ready, and we wouldn't have cheered. We wouldn't have stopped at a roadside café, and I wouldn't have ordered a sandwich, nor would my classmate have ordered coffee. We wouldn't have continued the trip, and we wouldn't have reached our destination. The stunning views wouldn't have been there for us to explore, and we wouldn't have taken pictures or had fun. After that, we wouldn't have returned home feeling tired but happy.

3. You saw off your friend at the airpot
Last month, I went to the airport to see off my friend. I arrived at his house in a taxi at 8 AM. I waited for him from 8 AM to 8:15 AM. He came out of his house with his luggage, looking a bit nervous but excited. Then we went to the airport. At that moment, I felt a little sad, knowing he was leaving for a long time. Stepping into the airport, we checked his flight information on the screen. He was flying to another country for work. After checking in his luggage, we sat down at a café to have a quick chat and a cup of coffee. He told me how excited he was about the new job, but I could also see a bit of sadness in his eyes. When it was time to say goodbye, we hugged, and I wished him all the best. He waved at me one last time before going through security. I watched him disappear into the crowd, feeling both happy for him and sad to see him go.

But if I hadn't gone to the airport to see off my friend, I wouldn't have arrived at his house in a taxi at 8 AM. I wouldn't have waited for him from 8 AM to 8:15 AM, and he wouldn't have come out with his luggage. We wouldn't have gone to the airport together. I wouldn't have felt sad knowing he was leaving. We wouldn't have checked his flight information or sat down at the café for a final chat. He wouldn't have told me about his excitement, and I wouldn't have seen the sadness in his eyes. We wouldn't have hugged, I wouldn't have wished him all the best, and I wouldn't have watched him disappear into the crowd.

4. You picked up cargoes from a seaport
Last week, I went to the seaport to pick up some cargoes. I arrived at the port at 9 AM with my truck, ready for the load. I waited at the entry gate from 9 AM to 9:30 AM while the workers processed the paperwork. The cargo manager walked over to me with a clipboard, and we discussed the cargo details. Then, I drove my truck to the designated loading area. At that moment, I felt a sense of responsibility, knowing how important the delivery was. The workers used cranes to load the large containers onto my truck. After about an hour, the cargo was securely fastened, and I double-checked everything to make sure it was safe. Once everything was in place, I signed the final documents and headed out of the port, ready to deliver the goods to their destination. It was a long but successful day.

But if I hadn’t gone to the seaport to pick up the cargoes, I wouldn’t have arrived at the port at 9 AM with my truck. I wouldn’t have waited at the entry gate from 9 AM to 9:30 AM, and the cargo manager wouldn’t have come over with a clipboard. I wouldn’t have driven my truck to the loading area, and I wouldn’t have felt that sense of responsibility. The workers wouldn’t have used cranes to load the containers, and I wouldn’t have needed to check the safety of the cargo. I wouldn’t have signed the final documents or headed out of the port with the goods. It wouldn’t have been a long but successful day.

5. You looked for a new apartment
Last month, I started looking for a new apartment. I left my old place early in the morning and began checking out different neighborhoods at around 9 AM. I visited a few apartments that were listed online, starting with one near the city center. The first apartment had a nice view, but it was too small for my needs. Then, I headed to another location, hoping to find something better. At that moment, I felt a mix of excitement and frustration, not knowing if I would find the right place. After a few more visits, I found an apartment that seemed perfect – spacious, with large windows and a quiet neighborhood. I spoke with the landlord, who gave me a tour and explained the rental details. By the end of the day, I felt more confident about the search and decided to apply for the apartment.

But if I hadn’t started looking for a new apartment, I wouldn’t have left my old place early in the morning. I wouldn’t have visited different neighborhoods or checked out the listings online. I wouldn’t have seen the apartment with the nice view or felt that mix of excitement and frustration. I wouldn’t have continued searching or found the spacious apartment with large windows. I wouldn’t have spoken with the landlord or learned about the rental details. In the end, I wouldn’t have applied for the apartment or felt confident about the process.
