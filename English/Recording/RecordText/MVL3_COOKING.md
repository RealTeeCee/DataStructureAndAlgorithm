Today I'm gonna show you how to make the iconic Beef Wellington recipe by one of the most famous Masterchef in the world - Gordon Ramsay.

Here are the Ingredients for the course: 
- 1 kg beef fillet
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 250g chestnut mushrooms
- 50g unsalted butter
- 1 large sprig of fresh thyme, leaves only
- 100ml dry white wine
- 12 slices prosciutto (also known as Parma ham)
- 500g puff pastry
- 2 egg yolks, beaten with 1 tsp water and a pinch of salt
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 200g beef trimmings
- 4 large shallots, peeled and sliced
- 12 black peppercorns
- 1 bay leaf
- 1 tbsp tomato purée
- 750ml red wine
- 750ml beef stock

And now for the Cooking part:
Begin by seasoning a 1 kg beef fillet and searing it in hot olive oil until browned. Let it cool while preparing the mushroom duxelles by finely chopping 250g of chestnut mushrooms and cooking them with butter and thyme until dry, then adding white wine and reducing until evaporated. Lay 12 slices of prosciutto (Parma ham) on cling film, spread the mushroom mixture over the prosciutto, and place the seared beef on top. Use the cling film to wrap the prosciutto and mushrooms around the beef tightly and refrigerate for 15 minutes. Roll out 500g of puff pastry, place the beef in the center, and wrap the pastry around it, sealing the edges with beaten egg yolk. Brush the entire Wellington with more egg yolk and chill for 30 minutes. Bake at 200°C for 25-30 minutes until the pastry is golden brown. For the red wine sauce, brown 200g of beef trimmings with shallots, peppercorns, bay leaf, and thyme, then add tomato purée and red wine, reducing by half. Add beef stock and simmer until thickened, then strain. Let the Beef Wellington rest before slicing and it's ready to serve with the rich red wine sauce. Thanks, and enjoy your meal.
