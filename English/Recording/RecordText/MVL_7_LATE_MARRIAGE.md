### Early Marriage - Addressing Opposing Views

# Counterpoint 1: "Early marriage gives more time to build a family and have children."
Response: Late marriage doesnâ€™t necessarily prevent people from having children, and advancements in reproductive health allow for flexibility. Quality parenting and family stability matter more than just the time span.
