last summer vacation, After reading a magazine about the most beautiful beach in Viet Nam, 
I felt inspired to plan to go on a trip to enjoy my holiday with my friends. First, We booked a flight, 
and then we booked the accommodation which is a small hostel near the beach.
As the time we were to depart, all of us felt eager and excited.
We set off early in the morning and arrived after the sun rose. The adventure began, and we spent the day swimming, sunbathing,
and playing beach sports wishing the day would never end. Now I still miss that happy day, 
I look forward to returning there on the other occasion.
