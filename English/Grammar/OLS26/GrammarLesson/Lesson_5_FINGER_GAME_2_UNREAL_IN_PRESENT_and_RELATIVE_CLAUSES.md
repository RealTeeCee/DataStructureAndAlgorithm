# Defining Relative Clauses
- The information provided in a defining relative clause is crucial in understanding the meaning of the sentence.
- The purpose of a defining relative clause is to clearly define whom or what we are talking about. Whithout this information, it would be difficult to know who or what is meant.

Ex: - The woman [who lives in apartment No.34] has been arrested
    - The document [that I need] has 'important' written at the top

* Note: - No comma "," in Defining Relative Clauses

# Non-Defining Relative Clauses
- Provide additional information which is not essential to understanding the meaning of the sentence.

Ex: - Mrs.Jackson, [who is very intelligent], lives on the corner.

* Note: - Comma "," put before Relative Pronoun and at end of the clause.
        - Never use "THAT" in Non-Defining Relative Clauses

# Note: use "THAT" not "WHICH" after these words:
ALL
ANY(THING)
EVERY(THING)
FEW
LITTLE
MANY
MUCH
NO(THING)
NONE
SOME(THING)
After SUPERLATIVE (ex: the strongest)

Ex: - It was everything THAT he had ever wanted
    - There were only a few THAT really interested him
