Ex: What do you do in Spring?
- There are 4 things that I usually do in Spring

First, I usually go shopping to buy the new clothes because I can't wear the Winter clothes in Spring; they are too heavy and warm

Second, I'll have to repaint my house, it is usually dirty after a long Winter and I need a fresher look

Third, I'll have to plant the fruit trees and flowers in my garden; they'll often grow faster in Spring

And Finally, I have to be ready for the Spring semester. I'll have to buy the books and go to school
