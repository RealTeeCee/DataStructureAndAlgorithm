# Linking Verbs
* A linking verb, also known as a copula, is a verb that connects the subject of a sentence with a subject complement, which can be a noun, pronoun, or adjective. Linking verbs do not show action; instead, they express a state of being or describe the subject. They provide a link or connection between the subject and the complement to provide more information about the subject.
