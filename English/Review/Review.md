Travel often brings joy and adventure, but sometimes, it can turn into a series of unfortunate events. Today I'll tell you about the worst trip I've ever experienced. It's a one-day trip to the Golden Scorpion Ecological Tourist Area in Đồng Nai. 
Every year, my friends and I take a vacation to explore new places and relax. We decided to go on a trip to visit the Golden Scorpion Ecological Tourist Area about eight years ago. During the trip, I was constantly dealing with one problem after another. Everything had been totally fine until I had a bad stomach the day before we were to depart. At that moment, I didn't want to cancel the trip just because of my health issue, so I worked around it by taking some medicine that I had bought at the local pharmacy. It seemed like the medicine had some effect, and I had felt good after that. Then finally, we started our trip. By half road to arrive there, My motorbike got a flat tire so I had to walk the motorbike more than 2 km to find the repair shop. Before I arrived at the destination, it was raining heavily and I had been riding in the rain without having a raincoat. Finally, I arrived, All my friends were eating lunch so I had lunch with them in my wet outfit. After that, The rain came back and We had to stay in huts till we went home without playing anything. Right now, I am still trying to recover from the stress and exhaustion that this trip caused. By the next summer, I will have been planning my vacations with much more attention to detail, ensuring that such a disaster never happens again. I told my friends that I wouldn't go on a one-day trip anymore.
