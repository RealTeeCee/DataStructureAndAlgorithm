# Graph
+ What is Graph?
    - Data structure that consists of a set of vertices or nodes connected by edges. It is used to represent relationships or connections between objects. Graphs are widely used in various fields, including computer science, network analysis, social sciences, and operations research.

+ Key characteristics: 
    * Vertices: Graphs consist of a set of vertices, also known as nodes. Vertices represent the objects or entities in the graph. Each vertex is typically labeled or identified in some way to distinguish it from other vertices.

    * Edges: Graphs are composed of edges, which are the connections between vertices. Edges represent the relationships or interactions between the objects in the graph. An edge can be directed, indicating a one-way relationship, or undirected, indicating a bidirectional relationship.

    * Degree: The degree of a vertex in a graph is the number of edges that are connected to it. In an undirected graph, the degree represents the number of neighboring vertices. In a directed graph, the degree is further divided into the in-degree (number of incoming edges) and the out-degree (number of outgoing edges) of a vertex.

    * Weight: Edges in a graph can be assigned weights or values that represent some kind of measurement or cost associated with the relationship between the connected vertices. Weighted graphs are useful for modeling scenarios where the relationships have different strengths or magnitudes.

    * Path: A path in a graph is a sequence of vertices connected by edges. It represents a route or a sequence of steps from one vertex to another. Paths can be simple (no repeated vertices) or allow for revisiting vertices.

    * Cycle: A cycle in a graph is a path that starts and ends at the same vertex, forming a closed loop. Cycles can be important in analyzing the behavior and properties of a graph.

    * Connectivity: The connectivity of a graph refers to how well the vertices are connected to each other. A graph can be connected, meaning there is a path between any two vertices, or it can be disconnected, meaning there are isolated subsets of vertices with no connection between them.

    * Directed vs. undirected: Graphs can be either directed or undirected. In a directed graph, edges have a specific direction, indicating a one-way relationship. In an undirected graph, edges have no direction, indicating a bidirectional or symmetric relationship.

    * Acyclic vs. cyclic: A graph can be acyclic, meaning it does not contain any cycles, or cyclic, meaning it contains at least one cycle. Acyclic graphs are often used in scenarios where there should be no looping or repetition of paths.

    * Density: The density of a graph refers to the ratio of the actual number of edges to the maximum possible number of edges. It provides an indication of how many connections exist in the graph relative to the total number of possible connections.

+ Realworld Usecases: 
    * Social Networks: Social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn use graphs to model and analyze social connections between users, suggesting friends, recommending relevant content, and identifying communities of interest.

    * Transportation Networks: Graphs are used to model transportation systems, including road networks, flight routes, and public transportation networks. They help optimize routes, plan logistics, and analyze traffic patterns.

    * Web Graphs: Search engines like Google use graphs to represent the web and determine the relevance and popularity of web pages through link analysis algorithms like PageRank. Graphs are also used in web scraping and web crawling.

    * Recommendation Systems: Graphs are used to build recommendation systems in e-commerce, streaming platforms, and content aggregators. They capture user preferences, item similarities, and collaborative filtering to suggest relevant products, movies, music, or articles.

    * Knowledge Graphs: Knowledge graphs organize structured and semantically connected data to represent relationships between entities, facilitating information retrieval and reasoning. Examples include Google's Knowledge Graph and Wikidata.

    * Fraud Detection: Graphs help detect fraudulent activities by analyzing patterns of connections and interactions between entities, such as financial transactions, network traffic, or user behavior, to identify suspicious behavior or clusters.

    * Network Analysis: Graphs are used to analyze and optimize network infrastructure, such as computer networks, social networks, and biological networks. They aid in understanding network properties, identifying key nodes, and predicting network behavior.

    * Recommendation Systems: Graph-based recommendation systems are used in online shopping, music streaming, and movie recommendations. By modeling user-item interactions as a graph, personalized recommendations can be generated based on similar users or items.

    * Bioinformatics: Graphs are used to analyze biological data, such as protein-protein interactions, gene regulatory networks, and metabolic pathways. They help understand complex biological systems and identify potential drug targets.

    * Supply Chain Management: Graphs are used to model and optimize supply chain networks. They represent the flow of goods, logistics routes, and relationships between suppliers, manufacturers, and distributors, aiding in efficient inventory management and demand forecasting.
